This is CPCI 3 of the Pascal-F Verifier, the path tracer and verification
condition generator.
Generating this on the SUN requires some painful kludges.  We wanted to have
the ability to read and write pipes in Pascal, a facility not normally
available in the language.  So we have some subroutines which make this
possible.  But these subroutines need a .h file which defines the Pascal-F
I/O tables, and SUN doesn't provide that file.  So the file has been adapted
from the 4.1BSD file, which is slightly different.  I'm not happy about this,
because I had to guess at the table format after examining some parts of
the Pascal library with adb.  So if pipe I/O trouble is experienced, this
mechanism is probably faulty.
