\"      This set of mm macro commands defines a book-like format.\"      The usual headings, H1 to H4, are used, but the results are\"      as follows.\"      .H 1 indicates a chapter heading.  Each chapter starts on a new\"      page, a large chapter heading is printed, and the chapter heading\"      becomes the running heading.\"      .H 2 starts a new page.\"      Lower level headings are simply in boldface, and become smaller\"      in size as heading level decreases.\"\"      Page numbers are of the form "chapter-page".  No page numbers\"      appear until the first heading is printed.\"\"      No title page is produced by these commands.\"                                      J.
