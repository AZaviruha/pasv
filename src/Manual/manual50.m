.H 1 "Examples"The examples in this chapter are designed to aid the user in learning touse the Verifier.  For the first example, a square root calculation,verification conditions have been generated by hand and informal proofsgiven.This example is intended to give the user some insight into how theVerifier examines programs..PThe second example, a set of routines for managing a circular buffer,shows the use of the verifier to verify only absence of run-time errors,and the maintenance of a simple invariant.  It is useful to notehow few assertions were required.  This example has been passed by theVerifier in the form shown..PThe third example, a very simple-minded engine control program,is intended to illustrate the use of assertions and proof variables inconstructing a verifiable Pascal-F program.  It also illustrates meansof programming within the restrictions required fora reliable and verifiable multi-process program.  This example also hasbeen passed by the Verifier.
