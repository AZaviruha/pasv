.H 1 "The rule builder"
In the previous chapter, the concept of
verification using

was introduced.
These rules must be created by the user and proven with machine assistance.
The rule builder is a tool used with the Verifier proper to construct
sound new rules and thus provide the Verifier with more knowledge.
