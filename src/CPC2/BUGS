1.  Miscinfo is not placed in tree item				[FIXED]2.  'fxlt' is duplicated in intprint name table			[FIXED]3.  Addresses of refer are not converted to bits		[FIXED]4.  At 15 procedures, programunittype will overflow.		[FIXED]5.  VALUE clause unimplemented in varfile (pass 1) 		[FIXED]6.  At 31 statements in a block, arg array in node will overflow7.  param addressing for VAR arguments is totally incorrect	[FIXED]8.  Trouble with record where first elt is array		[FIXED]9.  Non-callable routines get internal error			[FIXED]10. Anonomous types cause assertion failure			[FIXED]11. Need name entries in varfile for modules, main programs.	[FIXED]12. WITH of record with 1 entry causes type clash error msg	[FIXED]13. FORWARD declarations throw block count off14. Unset var errors appear for VALUE variables and hardware	[FIXED]15. new! / defined! args to genjexpr are ignored		[FIXED]16. On structure component assignment, entire struct "defined!" [FIXED]17. Generates long-case defined! expressions for param defined	[FIXED]18. Incorrect Jcode for x.old in entry/exit for callee		[FIXED]19. Pass I should check for missing } in comments.		[FIXED]20.

Type associated with REFER is not from object referred to   [FIXED]23. Field names in (selectr!.. ) should not be decorated	[FIXED]24. Need unique name generation for type names in pass 1	[FIXED]25. movem operator size field is incorrectly interpreted	[FIXED]26. defnd operator size field is misinterpreted		27. Subscripts in selectors passed by VAR should be .old values [FIXED]28. Anonomous record types cause assertion failure		[FIXED]29. FOR loop exit condition may not match implementation30. Still have problems with record with one field at calls.31. Loop operator jcode template is incorrect			[FIXED]32. Invariant scope detection is too restrictive		[FIXED]33. Side effect detection is overly restrictive34. Diagnostic for use of wrong kind of fn in assertion is poor [FIXED]35. Dominator routine used too early, from noteref in pass 2a.  [FIXED]36. INIT of module from non-main-program fails			[FIXED]37. LOOP operator Jcode is unsound				[FIXED]38. Producing type of rule function in type info is unsound	[FIXED]39.
